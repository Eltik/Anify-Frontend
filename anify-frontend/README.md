# Anify-Frontend
Web design for [Anify](https://anify.tv/).

## Development
As of now, Anify uses NextJS built using [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/). Anify has gone through about 7-8 recodes, and this is the most stable one yet. The code is a bit messy, but it works.

# TBD
The README for this project isn't done! Join our [Discord](https://anify.tv/discord) for more information.
